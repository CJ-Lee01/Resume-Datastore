# Resume Datastore

The purpose of this application is to allow users to build individual sections of their resume and piece it together based on requirements for different job applications.

Context: In order to have the best chance of getting a response after sending a resume, it is best for the job applicant to tailor their resume to the job application. They should not send the same resume for all their job applications.

Problem: It is also expected that many job applicants will apply for many roles to get the best role they want. 

Proposed solution: Have a program that ranks the components of a resume based on their relevance to the job application.

## Components of a resume
- Contact Information
- Professional Summary (should it be included?)
- Work Experience
  - Internship
  - Full-time
  - Part-time
  - Temporary
- Education
  - Level
- Skills (Unverified, hard and soft)
- Certifications and Training (Verified, not by application)
- Projects
- Achievements and Awards (Verified, not by application)
- Languages
- References (For referrals. What can they vouch for you?)
- Others (defined by user)

## Components of a job posting
This will be relevant when looking at how to match a resume to a job posting
- Job title
- Company info
- Location
- Job Summary 
- Responsibilities / Duties
- Requirements / Qualifications (necessary and preferred)
- Salary and Benefits
- Full time? Part time?
- Work Schedule

## Ranking the relevance of components of a resume to a job posting
1. Look for keywords in the job posting
2. Match each component to a skill in the job posting.
